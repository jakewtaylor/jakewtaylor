# Hey, I'm Jake 👋🏻

I'm a freelance web/app developer available for hire.

I have expertise with PHP, Javascript, Typescript, and CSS. I've worked with many tools/frameworks including Laravel, React & React Native, Angular, Vue, SCSS, Tailwind, and many others.
My preferred stack is Laravel with React, or Vue when only small amounts of interactivity are required.

I'm a full-stack developer, meaning I can help you build something fully functional that looks and feels great. Get in touch and let's work together!

If you want to see my full experience, please check my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jakewtaylor/). If you want to see some code, you're in the right place!
